## Notes for Review

1. **212cc Variants:** Predator 212 Non-Hemi, Hemi, Ghost, and 224 all share similar torque specs as they're based on the same engine block.

2. **Larger Engines:** 301, 420, and 670 have progressively higher torque values due to larger fasteners and higher stress.

3. **Honda GX200:** Uses official Honda specifications which may be slightly different from clones.

4. **Briggs 206:** Sealed racing engine - side cover should not be removed (seal breaks).

5. **79cc:** Smallest engine, uses lower torque values appropriate for smaller fasteners.

## Implementation Plan (After Approval)

1. Create database table or JSON structure for torque specs
2. Update torque specs page to fetch from database
3. Add all 10 engines to the dropdown
4. Ensure proper formatting and display

---

## Questions for Review

1. Are these torque values accurate for your use case?
2. Should we add more components (e.g., oil filter, fuel pump, etc.)?
3. Do you want to add metric equivalents (Nm)?
4. Should we include torque sequences/diagrams?
5. Any engine-specific notes to add?
