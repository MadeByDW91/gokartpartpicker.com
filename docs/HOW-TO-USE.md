# How to Use This System

> **Super simple — 3 steps**

---

## 🎯 The Simple Way

### Step 1: Check What's Next
Open `docs/NEXT-PROMPT.md` — tells you which prompt to run

### Step 2: Open the Prompt File
It will say something like: "File: `docs/prompts/A3-parts-pages.md`"

### Step 3: Copy & Paste
1. Open that file
2. Copy the markdown block (starts with "You are Agent...")
3. Paste into the agent (A3, A5, A6, etc.)

**That's it!**

## 📚 All Prompts

See `docs/prompts/INDEX.md` for a list of all prompts.

Each prompt is in its own file:
- `A3-engine-detail.md` → Goes to A3
- `A5-seed-parts.md` → Goes to A5
- `A1-engine-prices.md` → Goes to A1 or A5
- etc.

## 🔄 When Agents Finish

Just tell me:
- "A3 finished"
- "A5 finished"  
- "Both done"

I'll update `NEXT-PROMPT.md` with the next one.

---

## ❓ What If I'm Confused?

Just ask me:
- "What should I do next?"
- "Which prompt should I run?"
- "Is X done yet?"

I'll tell you exactly what to do.

*One file per prompt = no confusion!*
