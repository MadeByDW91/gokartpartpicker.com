## 📝 HOW THIS WORKS

**Simple 3 steps:**

1. **Check this file** → See what to do (above)
2. **Copy the prompt** → From here or `PROMPT-LIBRARY.md`
3. **Paste into agent** → A3, A5, A6, etc.

**When agents finish:**
- Tell me: "A3 done", "A6 done", or "both done"
- I update this file with the next prompt
- Repeat!

**That's it!** I handle all the tracking and coordination.
